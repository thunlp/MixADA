# MixADA: Adversarial Training with Mixup Augmentation for Robust Fine-tuning

This is the repo for reproducing our paper - Better Robustness by More Coverage: Adversarial Training with Mixup Augmentation for Robust Fine-tuning ([arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.15699)). 

## Dependencies 

I conducted all experiments under Torch==1.4.0, Transformers==2.3.0. You can see a complete list of dependencies in `requirements.txt`, although you don't have to install all of them as most of them are unnecessary for this codebase.

## Running 

I have included examples of how to run model training with MixADA as well as how to evaluate the models under adversarial attacks in `run_job.sh` and `run_job2.sh`. However, you need to modify the scripts to fill in your dataset and pretrained model checkpoint paths.
